Football League API is an API that provide the information about the Football League, Team, Sponsoring Company, Players and Manager. This project is dedicated for my learning journey of API Development, especially using Node.js, Express, Prisma and SQLite.       


To test this API locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine. Then, kindly download the zip file of the source code. After extract the folder, open the terminal and type       

```Shell
	npm install
	// This will install all the dependencies of the project
```       


I have use Nodemon along this API development. To run this API using Nodemon, simply type     

```Shell
  	npm run dev
```          

then, it will listening port on `3405`       

or, you can use built-in Node.js server. Just type       

```Shell
  	npm run serve
```          

then, it will listening port on `3405`
